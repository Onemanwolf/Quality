# .NET Application Quality

# Introduction

In this article, we will discuss the importance of code quality in .NET applications. We will explore various aspects such as unit testing, dependency injection, and abstraction between external dependencies.

# Code Quality

Code quality plays a crucial role in the success of any software project. It ensures that the code is readable, maintainable, and scalable. In the context of .NET applications, there are several key factors that contribute to code quality.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is an essential practice in software development. It involves writing automated tests to verify the behavior of individual units of code. By having a comprehensive suite of unit tests, developers can ensure that their code functions correctly and remains stable even after future changes.

### Here are the top five fundamentals of unit testing:

- **Test Independence**: Each unit test should be independent of other tests, ensuring that the outcome of one test does not affect the outcome of another.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage by testing different scenarios and edge cases to ensure that all possible paths of code execution are tested.
- **Test Readability**: Write clear and readable test cases with descriptive names and comments, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and expected behavior of each test.
- **Test Maintainability**: Keep test code clean and maintainable by following best practices, such as avoiding duplication, using appropriate abstractions, and organizing tests into logical groups.
- **Test Automation**: Automate the execution of unit tests to ensure they can be easily run and integrated into the development process, providing fast feedback on code changes.
Remember, these fundamentals help ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of unit testing in software development.

### Example of a Unit Test in C#

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class FormTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void ValidData_PassesValidation()
    {
        // Arrange
        var formData = new FormData
        {
            Name = "John Doe",
            Age = 30,
            Email = "johndoe@example.com"
        };

        var formValidator = new FormValidator();

        // Act
        var isValid = formValidator.IsValid(formData);

        // Assert
        Assert.True(isValid);
    }
}

public class FormData
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}

public class FormValidator
{
    public bool  IsValid(FormData formData)
    {
        // Perform validation logic here
        // Return true if the data is valid, false otherwise
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling between components. By injecting dependencies instead of creating them directly within a class, we can easily replace or modify those dependencies without affecting the entire codebase. This improves the testability and maintainability of the application.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)
Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC) provide several benefits in software development. Here are the top three reasons for using Dependency Injection and IoC:

- **Loose Coupling**: Dependency Injection promotes loose coupling between components. By injecting dependencies instead of creating them directly within a class, the class becomes independent of the specific implementation details of its dependencies. This allows for easier replacement or modification of dependencies without affecting the entire codebase.

- **Testability**: Dependency Injection makes it easier to write unit tests for individual components. By injecting mock or stub dependencies during testing, developers can isolate the component being tested and verify its behavior independently. This improves the testability of the application and enables more comprehensive testing.

- M**aintainability**: Dependency Injection and IoC improve the maintainability of the codebase. By decoupling components and promoting modular design, it becomes easier to understand, modify, and extend the code. Changes to one component do not ripple through the entire application, reducing the risk of introducing bugs and making the codebase more adaptable to future requirements.

### Example add a Startup.cs to Azure Functions

```csharp

using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(MyFunctionApp.Startup))]
namespace MyFunctionApp
{
    public class Startup : FunctionsStartup
    {
        public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
        {
            // Register your dependencies here
            builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
        }
    }
}
```

These reasons highlight the importance of Dependency Injection and IoC in achieving loose coupling, testability, and maintainability in software development.

## Abstraction and Clean Contracts

When working with external dependencies such as messaging frameworks or databases, it is important to establish clean contracts. Clean contracts define the expected behavior and interactions between different components. By using abstraction and clean contracts, we can decouple our code from specific implementations, making it easier to switch or upgrade external dependencies without impacting the rest of the application.

### Substitution Principle and Clean Contracts

The Substitution Principle is an important concept in software design that complements clean contracts. Here are the top three reasons why the Substitution Principle is important for clean contracts:

- **Flexibility**: By adhering to the Substitution Principle, clean contracts allow for easy substitution of implementations. This means that different implementations can be used interchangeably as long as they adhere to the contract. This flexibility enables developers to switch or upgrade external dependencies without impacting the rest of the application.

- **Modularity**: Clean contracts promote modularity by defining clear boundaries between components. By specifying the expected behavior and interactions, clean contracts enable components to be developed and tested independently. This modularity improves code organization, maintainability, and reusability.

- **Extensibility**: Clean contracts facilitate extensibility by providing a well-defined interface for adding new functionality. New implementations can be easily added without modifying existing code that relies on the contract. This allows for the application to evolve and adapt to changing requirements without introducing breaking changes.

C# Basic Subsitution Example:

```csharp

public interface I1099Form
{
    void Generate();
}

public class Basic1099FormR : I1099Form
{
    public void Generate()
    {
        // Generate basic 1099 Form R
        Console.WriteLine("Generating basic 1099 Form R...");
    }
}

public class Enhanced1099FormR : I1099Form
{
    public void Generate()
    {
        // Generate enhanced 1099 Form R with additional features
        Console.WriteLine("Generating enhanced 1099 Form R...");
    }
}

public class FormRGenerator
{
    private readonly I1099Form _formR;

    public FormRGenerator(I1099Form formR)
    {
        _formR = formR;
    }

    public void GenerateFormR()
    {
        _formR.Generate();
    }
}
```

These reasons highlight the importance of the Substitution Principle in achieving flexibility, modularity, and extensibility through clean contracts in software design.

## Declarative Approach

Using a declarative approach in .NET development can bring several benefits. Instead of focusing on how to achieve a certain outcome, developers can focus on what the desired outcome should be. This leads to more concise and expressive code, as well as easier maintenance and debugging.

### benefits of a declarative approach:

- Concise and expressive code: With a declarative approach, developers can focus on describing the desired outcome rather than the specific steps to achieve it. This leads to code that is more concise and expressive, making it easier to understand and maintain.

- Easier maintenance and debugging: Declarative code is often easier to maintain and debug because it separates the logic from the implementation details. This allows developers to make changes or fix issues without having to understand the intricate details of how the code works.

- Readability and understandability: Declarative code is often more readable and understandable because it describes the intent of the code in a clear and concise manner. This makes it easier for other developers to understand and collaborate on the codebase.

```csharp
public class BusinessValidationConfig
{
    public string RuleName { get; set; }
    public string ErrorMessage { get; set; }
    public ValidatioLogic ValidationLogic { get; set; }
}

public class TemplateConfig
{
    public string TemplateName { get; set; }
    public List<FieldConfig> Fields { get; set; }
    public List<BusinessValidationConfig> Rules { get; set; }
}

public class ValidationLogic

{
    public string Operator { get; set; }
    public string Value { get; set; }
}

 public enum Operator
    {
        Equal,
        NotEqual,
        GreaterThan,
        LessThan
    }



public class BusinessValidationService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    private List<BusinessValidationConfig> _config;
    private TemplateConfig _templateConfig;
    private string _errorMessage;
    private ValidationLogic _validationLogic;
    private string _ruleName;

    public BusinessValidationService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
        _config = new List<BusinessValidationConfig>();
    }

    public void LoadBusinessValidationConfig(string jsonFilePath)
    {
        var json = File.ReadAllText(jsonFilePath);
        var config = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<BusinessValidationConfig>>(json);

        foreach (var item in config)
        {
            if (EvaluateValidationLogic(item.ValidationLogic))
            {
                _ruleName = item.RuleName;
                _errorMessage = item.ErrorMessage;
                _validationLogic = item.ValidationLogic;
            }
        }
    }

    private bool EvaluateValidationLogic(string validationLogic)
    {
        // Evaluate the validation logic here
        // Return true or false based on the evaluation
    }



}
```

### Example of a Declarative Configuration File

```json
[
    {
        "RuleName": "ValidName",
        "ErrorMessage": "Name is required",
        "ValidationLogic": {"operator": "!=", "value": null}
    },
    {
        "RuleName": "Rule2",
        "ErrorMessage": "Validation failed for Rule2",
        "ValidationLogic": {"logic": "value2"}
    },
    {
        "RuleName": "Rule3",
        "ErrorMessage": "Validation failed for Rule3",
        "ValidationLogic": "logic3"
    }
]
```

### Tempalte for Declarative Configuration File

```json
[
    {
        "TemplateName": "TemplateName",
        "Fields": [
            {
                "FieldName": "FieldName",
                "FieldConfig": {
                    "Type": "String",
                    "Required": true,
                    "MinLength": 5,
                    "MaxLength": 10,
                    "Binding": "{$Binding}",
                    "Xpath": "{$Xpath}",
                    "Ypath": "{$Ypath}",

                }
            }
        ],
        "Rules": [
            {
                "RuleName": "RuleName",
                "ErrorMessage": "ErrorMessage",
               "ValidationLogic": {"logic": "value2"}
            }
        ]

    }
]
```


## Conclusion

In conclusion, maintaining code quality in .NET applications is crucial for their success. By incorporating practices such as unit testing, dependency injection, and clean contracts, developers can ensure that their code is robust, maintainable, and adaptable. Additionally, adopting a declarative approach can further enhance the readability and maintainability of the codebase.
